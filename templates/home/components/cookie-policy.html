	<p class="fw-bold fs-5 mt-3">What are cookies?</p>
	<p>
		Cookies are small data files that are placed on your
		computer
		or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are
		widely
		used by website owners in order to make their websites
		work, or
		to work more efficiently, as well as to provide
		reporting
		information.
	</p>
	<p>
		Cookies set by the website owner (in this case,
		{{ request.site.name }} are called "first party
		cookies".
		Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are
		called
		"third party cookies". Third party cookies enable third
		party
		features or functionality to be provided on or through
		the
		website (e.g. like advertising, interactive content and
		analytics). The parties that set these third party
		cookies
		can
		recognize your computer both when it visits the website
		in
		question and also when it visits certain other
		websites.
	</p>
	<p class="fw-bold fs-5 mt-3">Why do we use cookies?</p>
	<p>
		We use first and third party cookies for several
		reasons.
		Some
		cookies are required for technical reasons in order for
		our
		Websites to operate, and we refer to these as
		"essential"
		or
		"strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies also enable
		us
		to
		track and target the interests of our users to enhance
		the
		experience on our Online Properties.
		Third parties serve cookies through our Websites for
		advertising, analytics and other purposes. This is
		described in
		more detail below.
	</p>
	<p>
		The specific types of first and third party cookies
		served
		through our Websites and the purposes they perform are
		described below (please note that the specific cookies
		served
		may vary depending on the specific Online Properties
		you
		visit):
	</p>
	<p class="fw-bold fs-5 mt-3">How can I control cookies?</p>
	<p>
		You have the right to decide whether to accept or
		reject
		cookies. You can exercise your cookie rights by setting
		your
		preferences in the Cookie Consent Manager. The Cookie
		Consent
		Manager allows you to select which categories of
		cookies
		you
		acceptor reject. Essential cookies cannot be rejected
		as
		they
		are strictly necessary to provide you with services.
	</p>
	<p>
		The Cookie Consent Manager can be found in the
		notification
		banner and on our website. If you choose to reject
		cookies,
		you
		may still use our website though your access to some
		functionality and areas of our website may be
		restricted.
		You
		may also set or amend your web browser controls to
		accept
		or
		refuse cookies. As the means by which you can refuse
		cookies
		through your web browser controls vary from
		browser-to-browser,
		you should visit your browser's help menu for more
		information.
	</p>
	<p>
		In addition, most advertising networks offer you a way
		to
		opt
		out of targeted advertising. If you would like to find
		out
		more
		information, please visit&nbsp;<a

	<p class="fw-bold fs-5 mt-3">What about other tracking
		technologies, like web beacons?</p>
	<p>
		Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track
		visitors
		to
		a website. We may use other, similar technologies from
		time
		to
		time, like web beacons (sometimes called "tracking
		pixels"
		or
		"clear gifs"). These are tiny graphics files that
		contain a
		unique identifier that enable us to recognize when
		someone
		has
		visited our Websites or opened an e-mail including
		them.
		This
		allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns
		of
		users from one page within a website to another, to
		deliver
		or
		communicate with cookies, to understand whether you
		have
		come
		to the website from an online advertisement displayed
		on a
		third-party website, to improve site performance, and
		to
		measure the success of e-mail marketing campaigns. In
		many
		instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to
		function properly, and so declining cookies will impair
		their
		functioning.
	</p>
	<p class="fw-bold fs-5 mt-3">Do you use Flash cookies or
		Local
		Shared Objects?</p>
	<p>
		Websites may also use so-called "Flash Cookies" (also
		known
		as
		Local Shared Objects or "LSOs") to, among other things,
		collect
		and
		store information about your use of our services, fraud
		prevention
		and for other site operations.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you do not want Flash Cookies stored on your
		computer,
		you
		can
		adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash
		Cookies
		storage using the tools contained in the <a
			href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html"
			target="_BLANK">Website Storage Settings Panel</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		You can also control Flash Cookies by going to
		the&nbsp;<a
			href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager03.html"
			target="_BLANK">Global Storage Settings Panel</a>
		&nbsp;and&nbsp;following the instructions (which may
		include
		instructions that explain, for example, how to delete
		existing
		Flash Cookies (referred to "information" on the
		Macromedia
		site), how to prevent Flash LSOs from being placed on
		your
		computer without your being asked, and (for Flash
		Player 8
		and
		later) how to block Flash Cookies that are not being
		delivered
		by the operator of the page you are on at the time).
	</p>
	<p>
		Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict
		or
		limit
		acceptance of Flash Cookies may reduce or impede the
		functionality of some Flash applications, including,
		potentially, Flash applications used in connection with
		our
		services or online content.

	<p class="fw-bold fs-5 mt-3">Do you serve targeted
		advertising?
	</p>
	<p>
		Third parties may serve cookies on your computer or
		mobile
		device to serve advertising through our Websites. These
		companies may use information about your visits to this
		and
		other websites in order to provide relevant
		advertisements
		about goods and services that you may be interested in.
		They
		may also employ technology that is used to measure the
		effectiveness of advertisements. This can be
		accomplished
		by
		them using cookies or web beacons to collect
		information
		about
		your visits to this and other sites in order to provide
		relevant advertisements about goods and services of
		potential
		interest to you. The information collected through this
		process
		does not enable us or them to identify your name,
		contact
		details or other details that directly identify you
		unless
		you
		choose to provide these.
	</p>
	<p class="fw-bold fs-5 mt-3">How often will you update this
		Cookie
		Policy?</p>
	<p>
		We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in
		order
		to
		reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or
		for
		other operational, legal or regulatory reasons. Please
		therefore re-visit this Cookie Policy regularly to stay
		informed about our use of cookies and related
		technologies.
